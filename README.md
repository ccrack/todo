# Todo List App 

## Overview 

The Todo List App is a simple and efficient web application that allows users to manage tasks by creating, deleting, and filtering them based on their status. Users can add new tasks, remove completed tasks, and filter tasks by their status (All, Completed, Incomplete). This app provides a user-friendly interface (responsive) to help organize tasks and improve productivity. 

## Features 

* Create New Task: Users can add new tasks to the list. 

* Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are completed or no longer needed. 

* Filter Tasks: The app allows users to filter tasks based on their status: 

  - All: View all tasks, regardless of their status. 

  - Completed: View only the tasks marked as completed. 

  - Incomplete: View only the tasks that are yet to be completed. 

## Technologies Used 

* HTML: Structure and layout of the web app. 

* CSS: Styling to make the app visually appealing and easy to use. 

* React.js: Handling the task creation, deletion, and filtering logic. 

## How to Use 

1- Add New Task:

2- Delete Task: 

When a task is completed, you can click the "X" button next to it to remove it from the list.

## Future Improvements 

1 - Task Editing: Allow users to edit an existing task after it has been created.
